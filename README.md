# 1-Big-Every-Step
Track the list of things that we need to do and also share snippets aswell.

## To-Do List

## Race system
- [ ] Timer
- [ ] Timer will either be 'Next race in ...', 'Race starting in ...', or 'Race ending in ...'
- [ ] Join button will only show once it says 'Race starting in ...' and then will disappear once clicked or once it starts/ends
- [ ] Teleportation

## Other
- [ ] If the player that joins never played before show "@... joined the game for the first time!"
- [ ] Friend boosts, +0.1x size multiplier each friend, shows at bottom left or right

## Bugs
- [ ] A few of the multiplier prices in the button and the buying prompt price are not the same.
- [ ] Make teleporting when falling below map server sided rather than client sided, fixes the issue when you are too far away for stuff to be rendered on the client.
